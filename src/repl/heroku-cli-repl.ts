/**
 * A class that manages a Heroku CLI REPL process
 * and allows for durably executing commands via a queue.
 *
 * Durability is achieved by guaranteeing that commands are
 * executed in order and that the REPL process is restarted
 * if it exits unexpectedly, experiences an error, or times out
 * during command execution.
 *
 * A command that fails to complete will not be retried but
 * all output leading up to the failure is returned to the caller
 * and the REPL process is restarted. Any commands that remained in
 * the queue prior to the error will not be affected and execution
 * will continue once the new process is ready for input.
 *
 * If the REPL process is aborted or disposed of intentionally,
 * it will not be restarted and a new instance should be created.
 *
 * This maintains a single Heroku CLI process.
